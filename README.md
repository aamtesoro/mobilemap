Sample Google Map Android application
This project is a part of #100DaysOfCode group.

Day1 (2018/01/08):
Today i have created a basic working andorid maps project. Though it might seems very easy to start the project with Android 
studio, i come acrross issue with 'Update google service to start the map application'. I need to do bit of research to fix the 
problem. The app is compatible up to android 4.4 . To use google map in that andorid version, we need to install
"In the Android SDK Manager, you must install "Google APIs (x86 System Image)" under "Android 4.4.2 (API 19)" and restart the android 
studio to fix the problem.

Day2 (2018/01/09):
Today features added are
1. Show multiple different may types (Google maps)
2. Added marker on the map
3. Added content to the marker. When maker is clicked a popup will open and will show content there.
